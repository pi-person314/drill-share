# drill-share
This website is my first solo attempt at a full-stack app! The idea is similar to a workout app, except with the goal of finding and sharing brand new ways of training for your sport of choice! Feel free to contact me at [jmli314@berkeley.edu](jmli314@berkeley.edu) if you have any questions!

## How to Use
If you're new to this site, begin by navigating to [drill-share.vercel.app](drill-share.vercel.app) and creating an account. You'll be immediately redirected to your dashboard, where you'll be able to view drills recommended to you based on your sports of interest, as well as your most popular drills and training sessions (once you've created some). From here, you'll have 3 main options for what to do next.

1. Navigate to the browse page and check out some drills shared by other users. Feel free to use the filters to find drills suitable for you. If you like what you see, give it a like or save it to use in your training sessionns!
2. Head over to the drills page to see your created and saved drills. Sort them if you want to organize them nicely. To create your own drill, simply click the big plus and fill out all the necessary fields. Keep in mind that for every one of your drills that receives 10 or more likes, you'll receive a contribution point on your dashboard!
3. Check out the training page and begin a new session. You'll be prompted to select a sport that you want to train, and you'll be able to drag and drop your saved drills into the various sections of your training. The training session itself will prompt you to record yourself doing each drill, and it'll provide a space for you to take notes if you wish to review them later. Finally, if you complete a training session every day, you'll be able to maintain a daily streak on your dashboard, so stay motivated!
